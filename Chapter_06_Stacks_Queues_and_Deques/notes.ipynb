    "## 6.1 Stacks\n",
    "* A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the ***last-in, first-out (LIFO)*** principle.\n",

    "### 6.1.1 The Stack Abstract Data Type\n",
    "Formally, a stack is an abstract data type (ADT) such that an instance `S` supports the following two methods:<br />\n",
    "**S.push(e):** Add element `e` to the top of stack `S`.<br />\n",
    "**S.pop():** Remove and return the top element from the stack `S`; an error occurs if the stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6.1.2 Simple Array-Based Stack Implementation\n",
    "* Although a programmer could directly use the list class in place of a formal stack class, lists also include behaviors (e.g., adding or removing elements from arbitrary positions) that would break the abstraction that the stack ADT represents. Also, the terminology used by the list class does not precisely align with traditional nomenclature for a stack ADT, in particular the distinction between append and push. Instead, we demonstrate how to use a list for internal storage while providing a public interface consistent with a stack.\n",

Those calls run in a total of $O(n)$ time, even considering the amortized nature of the $O(1)$ time bound for those methods. Given that our selection of possible delimiters, `({[`, has constant size, auxiliary tests such as `c in lefty` and `righty.index(c)` each run in $O(1)$ time. Combining these operations, the matching algorithm on a sequence of length $n$ runs in $O(n)$ time.\n",

    "### 6.2.1 The Queue Abstract Data Type\n",
    "* Formally, the queue abstract data type defines a collection that keeps objects in a sequence, where element access and deletion are restricted to the first element in the queue, and element insertion is restricted to the back of the sequence. This restriction enforces the rule that items are inserted and deleted in a queue according to the ***first-in, first-out (FIFO)*** principle.\n",

    "### 6.2.2 Array-Based Queue Implementation\n",
    "* For the stack ADT, we created a very simple adapter class that used a Python list as the underlying storage. It may be very tempting to use a similar approach for supporting the queue ADT. As easy as this would be to implement, it is ***tragically inefficient***.\n",
