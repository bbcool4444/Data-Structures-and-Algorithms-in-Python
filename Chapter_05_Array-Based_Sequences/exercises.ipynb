    "**Justification:** Let us assume that one cyber-dollar is enough to pay for the execution of each append operation in $S$, excluding the time spent for growing the array. Also, let us assume that growing the array from size $k$ to size $2k$ requires $3k$ cyber-dollars for the time spent initializing the new array. We shall charge each append operation **seven** cyber-dollars. Thus, we overcharge each append operation that does not cause an overflow by **six** cyber-dollars. Think of the **six** cyber-dollars profited in an insertion that does not grow the array as being “stored” with the cell in which the element was inserted. An overflow occurs when the array S has $2^i$ elements, for some integer $i ≥ 0$, and the size of the array used by the array representing $S$ is $2^i$. Thus, doubling the size of the array will require **$3 \\cdot 2^i$** cyber-dollars. Fortunately, these cyber-dollars can be found stored in cells $2^{i−1}$ through $2^i − 1$. (See Figure 5.14.) Note that the previous overflow occurred when the number of elements became larger than $2^i−1$ for the first time, and thus the cyber-dollars stored in cells $2^{i−1}$ through $2^i − 1$ have not yet been spent. Therefore, we have a valid amortization scheme in which each operation is charged **seven** cyber-dollars and all the computing time is paid for. That is, we can pay for the execution of $n$ append operations using **$7n$** cyber-dollars. In other words, the amortized running time of each append operation is $O(1)$; hence, the total running time of $n$ append operations is $O(n)$."

In this case, by sorting the sequence of elements, we are guaranteed that any duplicate elements will be placed next to each other. Thus, to determine if there are any duplicates, all we need to do is perform a sin- gle pass over the sorted sequence, looking for consecutive duplicates. A Python implementation of this algorithm is as follows:\n",

It guarantees a worst-case running time of $O(nlogn)$; see Chapter 12 for a discussion of common sorting algorithms. Once the data is sorted, the subsequent loop runs in $O(n)$ time, and so the entire unique2 algorithm runs in $O(nlogn)$ time."
